# Implementation plan

Claude Code's working file: where we are, what comes next, how each step is tested. Read it at the start of every
session (after `CLAUDE.md`), update it before ending one.

**Keeping this file small**
- *Resume here* is **overwritten** every session, never appended (≤ 12 lines).
- Tick a slice when it is on `main` with all checks green. When a milestone closes, collapse its slices into one line
  (what shipped + deviations worth knowing). Git history is the changelog: no step-by-step logs here.
- *Notes* holds only what a future session would otherwise rediscover the hard way. Delete notes that stop being true.
- Owner decisions on game rules go to `GAME_RULES.md`, on behaviour to `SPEC.md`, on architecture to an ADR, not here.
- Target size: under ~250 lines. When a phase closes, replace its plan with a 3-line summary.

## Resume here
- **Phase 1 · M7 (mobile): 7.1 and 7.2 done, 7.3 next, then M8.** 7.3 (`web`): the result row as a card with add-to-target,
  and an e2e that every interactive element is at least 44 × 44 px on mobile (Pixel 7 and iPhone 14 projects; axe on the
  pages it touches). Today the targets are 44 px under `pointer: coarse` (facet buttons, sort `select`, party toolbar, slots,
  the add button, the tabs are 64 px high), but nothing checks it: measure every `button`, `a`, `input`, `select` of Explore,
  the open filters sheet and the Party tab, and fix what falls short (the copy buttons, the chip remove buttons and the
  keyword tokens inside descriptions are the likely ones; WCAG 2.5.8 allows a 24 px target with spacing, DESIGN asks 44).
  Read DESIGN.md (Result list, Accessibility) and `docs/prototype/Mobile.dc.html` (its `.addb` is 44 × 44).
  The tabs (7.2) are under **1100 px**, not 700: that is where the party stopped fitting beside the list; the filters stay a
  sheet under 700. Two fixed bars can stack at the foot (Filters button 61 px above the tab bar 64 px): `--bars-height`.
- Open for the owner, none blocking: GAME_RULES open questions 1-5 (allies vs enemies; "afflicted with" as a trigger;
  when a mastery is active; Diabolic Horde; Dusty Struggle's wording).
- Every green commit on `main` is deployed to Pages (D2). The nightly `data-refresh` works; read its report before merging.
- Before coding: `git pull`, `gh run list --branch main -L 3` (main must be green), `gh pr list` (data-refresh PRs).

## Owner decisions (2026-10-16)
| # | Decision | Recorded in |
|---|---|---|
| D1 | Repo `Cis8/siralim-ultimate-teambuilder`, public, Pages base path `/siralim-ultimate-teambuilder` | here |
| D2 | The compendium authors agreed (2026-10-16): deploy every commit on `main` once CI is green | `deploy.yml` |
| D3 | Node 24 LTS, pnpm via corepack | ADR-0002 |
| D4 | No PRs: direct commits to `main`, quality guaranteed by gates and `CLAUDE.md` rules | ADR-0007 |
| D5 | Slots per kind; Avatar innate-only; special kinds artifact-only; fallback colour `#8fa1b3` | GAME_RULES R1, R6, R7 |
| D6 | `masteryFamily` ≠ `partyRequirement`; all masteries are potential sources in Phase 1 | GAME_RULES R3 |
| D7 | Random debuffs: regex + overrides, `target` + `activation`, enemy-only set | GAME_RULES R5 |
| D8 | Buff/debuff lists from canonical sources; `canBeRandomlyApplied`; v2.0 wins | GAME_RULES R8, SPEC §4 |
| D9–D13 | Defaults accepted: Phase 1 coverage = covered/missing only; free text is substring; overrides need `reason:`; data-refresh PR runs its own checks; GAME_RULES open questions don't block Phase 1 | SPEC, here |

## Notes (toolchain gotchas)
- Node 24 via nvm (`nvm use` reads `.nvmrc`); pnpm 12 via corepack. pnpm enforces a minimum release age, so versions
  published in the last day are skipped. That is expected.
- TypeScript is pinned `~6.0`: typescript-eslint and svelte-check do not support TS 7 yet.
- SvelteKit 3: config in `apps/web/vite.config.ts`; there is no `svelte.config.js`. tsconfig extends `$app/tsconfig`.
  `$lib` is gone (use relative imports or `#lib/*` subpath imports).
- `ssr.noExternal: ['cookie']` in the Vite config: without it the prerender step cannot resolve `cookie` under pnpm.
- Internal links need `resolve()` from `$app/paths`; external links use `lib/components/external-link.svelte`.
- The RTK hook compacts command output: vitest prints nothing useful through it, and `cat` of a long file can drop lines
  (a test file seemed to lack its `vitest` import). Use `rtk proxy <command>` for the raw output, or Read.
- A data-refresh PR shows a `pull_request` CI run with conclusion failure, no jobs and no log (opened by the bot). Ignore
  it; judge `main` with `gh run list --branch main`.
- pnpm in CI fails on unapproved dependency build scripts (`ERR_PNPM_IGNORED_BUILDS`), locally it only warns:
  `allowBuilds` in `pnpm-workspace.yaml` must list every package that has one.
- Pipeline scripts run with `tsx` (the sources use extensionless imports, which plain Node cannot load).
- Prettier skips Markdown on purpose (hand-wrapped prose, tables).
- Windows clone: `.gitattributes` makes every checkout LF. Git for Windows sets `core.autocrlf=true`, which gave a CRLF tree
  where `.editorconfig`, Prettier and so `pnpm check` (the pre-push hook) failed on every file. Node 24 is not the default
  there: `fnm install 24`, put `%APPDATA%\fnm\node-versions\v24.22.0\installation` on PATH (from PowerShell: Git Bash does not
  expand `%APPDATA%`), `corepack prepare pnpm@12.14.0 --activate`. `gh` may be missing: read CI from
  `https://api.github.com/repos/Cis8/siralim-ultimate-teambuilder/actions/runs?branch=main&per_page=3`.
- `asset()` from `$app/paths` is typed with the names of the files in `static/`, and the dataset file is renamed whenever the
  data changes, so a literal name would break the typecheck of the next data-refresh: find the dataset next to
  `data/manifest.json` (`lib/composition-root.ts`). `base` is no longer exported.
- Playwright browsers are not part of `pnpm install`: once per machine, `pnpm exec playwright install chromium webkit` (in
  `apps/web`), or every e2e fails with "Executable doesn't exist".
- typescript-eslint cannot see the props of an imported `.svelte` component (svelte-check can): a callback passed to one
  needs its parameters typed (`onchange={(query: string) => …}`), or `no-unsafe-assignment` fires.
- Changing what the pipeline emits does not change `apps/web/static/data` by itself: run `pnpm pipeline:fetch && pnpm pipeline:build`
  and commit the result (`chore(data)`), or the app keeps showing the old shape (the dataset lacked keywords until M5.6).
- `playwright test` reuses whatever answers on port 4173: a `vite preview` left running serves the old build. Stop it first
  (on Windows one is often left behind after a run: stop the process that listens on the port).
- `virtual-list`: `@tanstack/virtual-core` rebuilds what it measured from the last row that changed and keeps the keys of
  the rows above it, so a key function that reads the `keys` prop when called, or a list that changes under a pending
  measure, draws a trait twice (`each_key_duplicate`, a 500 page). `options()` snapshots the keys and `measure()` runs when
  the list is another one. The e2e that proves it is the chain of filters taken off one by one (`draws no trait twice…`).
- e2e: wait for the first row before typing or clicking (`openExplore`): the traits load after hydration, and a field filled
  earlier is lost (WebKit gets there last). Safari does not focus a button that is clicked: to test focus, use the keyboard.
- SvelteKit 3 navigation: `pushState` / `replaceState` are deprecated and a shallow entry keeps `page.url` on the page
  underneath, so the address is written with `goto(resolve('/?…'), { replace, reset: false })`: a real navigation on the same
  route, with no load to run. `reset: false` leaves scroll and focus alone, also on back/forward. `afterNavigate` tells the
  page's own write (`type: 'goto'`, ignored: reading it back would put the text of the last pause over what was typed since)
  from `enter` / `popstate` / `link` (read). A navigation started while another is in flight drops the first one's history
  entry, hence the writer's queue. The lint rule `no-navigation-without-resolve` accepts `resolve()` only with `'/'` or
  `` `/?${string}` ``, and `page.url` is a read-only type: build a `URL` from its `href`.
- e2e: `rows` is the list items of the *Results* region (the party panel has lists too). Playwright will not click a button
  that says `aria-disabled="true"`: `click({ force: true })` is the person pressing it. A poll that waits for an address
  parameter can be satisfied by an earlier write: wait for the value the step just wrote.
- `rtk` is not on every machine: run `pnpm exec vitest …` directly; in PowerShell prefix `$env:PATH` with the Node 24 folder.
- `.visually-hidden` is `position: absolute`: inside a scroll area that is not itself positioned it escapes the scroller and
  makes the nearest positioned ancestor scrollable (the bottom sheet's title slid out of view); the area gets `position: relative`.
- e2e, filters on a narrow screen: they are in the sheet, so `facet` / `side` / `mode` / `flag` read their state shut or open
  (`includeHidden`), a press needs `openFilters`, and anything on the page behind needs `closeFilters` first (a modal dialog
  blocks it). `explore-page.ts` is the one place that knows the 700 px breakpoint, as `FiltersRegion` and `+page.svelte` are
  for the app.
- e2e, tabs: under 1100 px the party is on its own tab, so a test shows it (`showParty` in `party-page.ts`) before it reads or
  presses anything in it, and `findRow` / `addToParty` bring the search forward; both do nothing on a wide screen.
  `explore-page.ts` knows the 1100 px breakpoint as well as the 700 px one. A `toHaveCount(0)` on a locator inside `partyPanel`
  passes without the tab (the region is not in the page then): show it first. A `click({ force: true })` does not look at what
  covers the element: under the fixed bars it hits a bar (scroll the element to the middle first).
- Do not rewrite files with Python's text mode on Windows: it writes CRLF into an LF tree (use the Edit tool).
- `packages/core` and `pipeline` export TypeScript source (`exports: ./src/index.ts`); there is no build step.

## Phase 1 — slices
One slice = one commit (or a few) on `main`. *T:* = tests written with or before the code (TDD for `core`).

### M1 Scaffold — done
Monorepo, strict TS, ESLint with package-boundary rules (tested in `tools/boundaries.test.ts`) + dependency-cruiser,
Prettier, Vitest projects, Playwright (desktop Chromium, Pixel 7, iPhone 14 WebKit) + axe, CI, Pages deploy,
app shell with tokens, self-hosted fonts and footer credits.

### M2 Pipeline v1 — done
`pnpm pipeline:fetch` (retries, one `SheetSource` per tab) and `pnpm pipeline:build` run parse → clean and validate → ids →
base enrichment (kind, stacks, R3 requirement, R5 random debuff) → dataset + manifest + Markdown report with a diff against
the previous build; the nightly `data-refresh.yml` opens a PR when the data changes. Real v2.0: 1,780 traits, 704 KB
(~100 KB gzip). Deviations: an id collision fails the build instead of getting a suffix (SPEC §5/§6); the pinned snapshot
(`pipeline/fixtures/traits-v2.0.csv`) and the GAME_RULES counts test (`build/real-sheet.test.ts`) landed with 2.4; nothing is
rewritten when the hash is unchanged.

### M3 Keyword extraction — done (with its follow-up)
`core`: a `taxonomy` registry (20 debuffs and 18 buffs from the wiki, cross-checked with the Codex Reference; mechanics,
triggers with a battle phase, the no-stack flag), `createKeywordMatcher` (spans), `assignRoles`, one `extractKeywords`
used by `enrichTraits`. `pipeline`: `overrides.yaml` with a schema, keywords in the dataset (2,174 mentions; 275 applies /
262 uses), committed snapshots in `packages/pipeline/snapshots/`, and a *Taxonomy* section in the report (candidates,
differences with the canonical lists). Deviations: Barrier is a buff, not a mechanic (both sources and the compendium say
so); buffs and debuffs match only as capitalised names (25 false positives otherwise); an opening condition makes a
status `uses`, which refines SPEC §4. All 537 role mentions were read by hand; 11 are overridden.
Owner decisions of 2026-10-16 added three things (3.8-3.10): the role `resists` for protective mentions (GAME_RULES R9),
`Trait.conditionalSources` for the "whichever of these debuffs" pair traits (R10), and the `effect` keyword kind with
Seal/Sealed, Dire Wolves, Zombies and Mega Magic, plus Charges, Cascading and Fused as mechanics (R11). Dataset v2.0 now
has 2,299 mentions: 311 applies, 270 uses, 21 resists.

### M4 Query core — done
`core/src/query/`: lexer with spans, error-tolerant parser (`{ast, tokens, diagnostics}`, never throws, repairs reported),
field registry (`FieldDefinition` with `highlightsDescription`), per-trait index and `evaluate`, `createHighlighter` and
`serialise`, all folds over `visitQuery`. Deviations: a term under two NOTs (`--weak`) is highlighted (QUERY_LANGUAGE §4);
the serialiser quotes a value exactly when the lexer would read it otherwise (it asks the lexer), and writes `-`, a space and
` OR `.

### M5 Explore UI — done
`core`: `ExploreState` + URL codec, `search(state)` with facets and sort strategies, chip operations on the query text,
`clickKeyword`, `descriptionParts`. `web`: three columns (filters | results | party), query input, chip row, result count in
`aria-live`, virtualised results against the window (`@tanstack/virtual-core`), keyword tokens by role shape, `<mark>`
highlights, facet panel (`aria-pressed`), effective query + copy, empty state, and the URL kept in step with the state
(`page-address`, `page-url-writer`; SPEC §7). Deviations worth knowing: the filters are written as a query and that
text is what is searched (`filterQuery`); a click on a token turns the other side of the keyword off, the panel does not;
filter chips are remove-only; a pressed token is a ring, not a fill (contrast of a highlight); narrow screens stack the
panel above the list until the bottom sheet (M7.1); back and forward bring back the state and start the list over.

### M6 Party planner — done
`core`: immutable `Party` + `SLOT_POSITIONS`, slot-rule registry (R1, R6), `PartyCommand` + `PartyHistory`, the `Planner`
(history + target slot), `nextEmptySlot` / `firstEmptySlot`, `partyCoverage` (applies, relies on, covered / missing,
non-stacking duplicates), the address codec, `lostTraitSearch`. `web`: party panel with coverage, target toggle per slot,
Undo / Redo / Clear / Ctrl+Z, "Add to" on every result with the rule's reason when refused, "In party" marker, copy link,
"not found in vX" slots with a search, the last party in `localStorage`, one writer for the search and the party in the
address. Deviations worth knowing: the party is a comma list in the address, not base64url (ADR-0008); choosing a target
replaces the history entry instead of pushing one; undo returns the target to the slot of the edit; a trait that applies and
relies on the same keyword covers itself (as in the prototype); the last party is used only when the address names none.

### M7 Mobile
- [x] **7.1** Bottom sheet on a modal `<dialog>` (`BottomSheet`, swapped for the column by `FiltersRegion` under 700 px, opened
      by a fixed "Filters" bar). *e2e:* focus trapped, Esc closes, focus returns (`filters-sheet.test.ts`). The e2e helpers
      `openFilters` / `closeFilters` open and close the sheet on a narrow screen and do nothing on a wide one.
- [x] **7.2** Explore/Party tabs (`TabBar`, ARIA tabs) under 1100 px, `tab=party` in the address (`page-tab.ts`, a step of the
      history), the page scrolled back to where each tab was left, no Synergies tab before Phase 2. The view not shown is laid
      out but `visibility: hidden; height: 0`, not `display: none` (the virtual list would measure its rows as 0 px). The
      bars at the foot leave room (`--bars-height`) and the root's `scroll-padding-bottom` keeps a focused control clear of
      them. `filledSlots` joined `core`. *e2e:* `tabs.test.ts`; the party e2e switch tabs with `showParty` / `showExplore`.
- [ ] **7.3** Result card with add-to-target. *e2e:* every interactive element ≥ 44×44 px on mobile; axe.

### M8 Hardening
- [ ] **8.1** Performance: `vitest bench` on the snapshot + e2e keystroke latency with 4× CPU throttling, p95 < 16 ms
      (criterion 9). Inverted index only if the budget is missed.
- [ ] **8.2** Size budgets (initial JS ≤ 150 KB gzip, data ≤ 300 KB gzip) + Lighthouse CI.
- [ ] **8.3** Keyboard-only e2e walkthrough (criterion 8); contrast test of the DESIGN tokens on every surface they use;
      screen-reader checklist for the owner.
- [ ] **8.4** Final credits (authors confirmed with the owner), README, docs, table mapping acceptance criteria to tests.
